# Fine Scale Pesticide Risk Prediction Based on Land Use
## Project Overview

**Owner/s:** Josie (Yee Hang) Yip and Ryan Turner  
**Project Name:** ine Scale Pesticide Risk Prediction Based on Land Use
**Date Started:** 19/02/2024  
**Date Last Updated:** 13/11/2024 
### Project Description
The aim of the project is to assess the predictability of using land use data to achieve fine-scale prediction of pesticide mixture risks in waterways. 
The code serves the purpose of preparing data for prediction and validation, as well as for data visualisation.
